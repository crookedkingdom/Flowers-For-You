# 🌸 Flowers for You

**Flowers for You** is a little animated webpage I created to send a glowing, blooming flower to people I care about — kind of like a digital bouquet. 💐

This project was part of my coding practice, and it turned into something beautiful. I used only HTML and CSS — no JavaScript — and learned a lot about animations, gradients, layering, and creative styling.
